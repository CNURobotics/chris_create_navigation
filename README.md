chris_create_navigation
======

This package contains gazebo models, launch files, and parameters for setting up navigation experiments with the chris_ros_create setup using either ROS Navigation (move_base)
or the newer ROS FlexBE-based flexible_navigation package (https://github.com/CNURobotics/flexible_navigation)

This version uses TwistStamped.msg for the velocity command as opposed to the Twist.msg in the original.
